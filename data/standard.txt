# This is an example config file for Cluedo, with the standard objects and board layout.
# It also contains some info about the expected syntax of this file.
# As you might have guessed, any line starting with '#' is a comment. Blank lines anywhere
# in the file are also ignored.

# The file must begin with a definition of the game's objects, in a simplified YAML layout.
# The first line (by convention) is simple a sequence of three dashes.
---
# After that come four groups: suspects, rooms, passages and weapons.
# A group is denoted using the group name followed by a colon. The items are on indented
# lines underneath it. Generally speaking, items in a hash/map consist of colon-separated
# key-value pairs and items in an array/list consist of a dash followed by a value.
suspects:
  # Suspects consist of a single letter ID, a name and a colour. The ID is used to set the
  # start location on the board definition below, and to show the location of the player
  # with that token in the (default) text interface.
  s: Miss Scarlett [red]
  p: Professor Plum [purple]
  e: Mrs. Peacock [blue]
  g: The Reverend Green [green]
  m: Colonel Mustard [yellow]
  w: Mrs. White [white]
rooms:
  # Rooms are similar to suspects, but only need an ID and a name. This ID is also for
  # setting which spaces the room occupies in the board definition.
  S: Study
  H: Hall
  O: Lounge
  L: Library
  D: Dining Room
  B: Billiard Room
  C: Conservatory
  A: Ballroom
  K: Kitchen
passages:
  # Passages are slightly different: the key and value are both room names, and define the
  # start and end of the passage respectively. Note that passage definitions are one-way,
  # so for a two-way passage (like in the standard layout) you must have two entries!
  Study: Kitchen
  Lounge: Conservatory
  Conservatory: Lounge
  Kitchen: Study
weapons:
  # Weapons are defined as a simple array of names
  - Dagger
  - Lead piping
  - Revolver
  - Rope
  - Candlestick
  - Spanner

# Now for the board definition. It starts with a long line of dashes, which must be equal
# to the width of the board, so a sequence of 24 dashes means that program will assume a
# 24-square wide board follows
------------------------
# After the dashes comes the body of the board. Each line defines one row, and each character
# defines one cell. The row must end with a '|' (vertical bar) - this is considered to be
# outside the board, so it will be (for example) the 25th character of a 24-wide board row.
#
# - A blank space means that the cell is considered to be outside the board and is therefore unreachable.
# - A '.' (period) means that the cell is part of a corridor.
# - A character defined as the ID of a suspect token (above) defines that token's start location.
# - A character defined as the ID of a room (above) means that the cell is part of that room.
# - A '_' (underscore) defines a vertical door (can be accessed from above/below).
# - A '/' (forward slash) defines a horizontal door (can be accessed from left/right).
#
# Note that when processing a door, the program will look left and right (NOT above and below)
# to find out which room the door is part of.
